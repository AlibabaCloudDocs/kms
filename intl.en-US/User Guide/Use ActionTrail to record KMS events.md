# Use ActionTrail to record KMS events {#concept_87440_zh .concept}

KMS has been integrated with the [ActionTrail console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/actiontrail)service. You can view the events performed by all users \(including the primary account and RAM users\) on your resource instances in ActionTrail.

The KMS information recorded by ActionTrail includes all APIs except DescribeRegions. For more information, see [KMS event log examples](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/ActionTrail Event Examples/KMS event log examples.md#).

For event details, see [ActionTrail event log syntax](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/ActionTrail event log syntax.md#).
