# Activate KMS

Before you can use Key Management Service \(KMS\), you must activate it. This topic describes how to activate KMS.

An Alibaba Cloud account is created, and real-name verification is completed for the account. For more information, see [Account registration](https://account.alibabacloud.com/register/intl_register.htm) and [Real-name verification](https://account-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/intlAuth).

## Activate KMS in the KMS console

1.  Log on to the [KMS activation page](https://common-buy-intl.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c63.p38356.879954.8.23de173enKcA29&commodityCode=kms_intl#/open).

2.  Read and select **Key Management Service Terms of Service**.

3.  Click **Activate Now**.

    After KMS is activated, you are charged based on your actual resource usage. For more information, see [Billing](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing.md).


## Activate KMS by using the API

You can call the [OpenKmsService](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Other API operations/OpenKmsService.md) operation to activate KMS.

**Note:** You can call the [DescribeAccountKmsStatus](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Other API operations/DescribeAccountKmsStatus.md) operation to query the KMS status of the Alibaba cloud account.
